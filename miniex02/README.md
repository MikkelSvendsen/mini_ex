The coding proces for this sketch was relatively light and the program as well is pretty simple. Basically, this has been my first experience with coding a program on my own. It gave me an insight to the constraints and workarounds I have to learn or teach myself by coding in practise. It was both frustrating and enlightening; coding seems much about logic, yet very time consuming when trying to figure out something complex. It resulted in a sketch not really expressing wholly my initial idea, but does give an impression of what I wanted to do (or the direction I was heading). Instead of focusing on the various ways to reach my ideas here I trained myself in understanding the coordinate system better, getting a stronger feeling about coding and reading up on examples and some tutorials (however not implementing it, but being playful about it).

I feel confident that my next exercise is gonna have some (more) complex functions to it!

My idea about what constitutes a program has adapted a bit through coding in practise, but not really changed. I believe that this exercise has taught me better that coding really is complex, but has also provided me personally more reason to further explore this world of coding language. Its frustrating yet itriguing and exiting. I tryout examples and tutorials and things happen.

What is an error? Errors can be several things. To me in this particular exercise I was trying to express an error through faulty 'language' in terms of not 'fitting in' with the system that needs to hear sound. My idea here is that the loud-speakers send out different sound 'types/languages', while in order to decode these sounds and understand them you must have the right receiver. Obviously the color and shapes play the roles of determining if theres a fit. The error here can be the shape or color of sound provided by the loudspeaker doesnt fit either the color of shape of the ear (receiver). This is in part an error, because the system doesnt match.

An error can be something in a system that is not made properly, much like the coding process; if you mess it up somewhere it can end the program with an error because the program cant 'read/understand' the code.
