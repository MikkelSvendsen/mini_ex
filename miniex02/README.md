The coding proces for this sketch was relatively light. It gave me an insight to the constraints and workarounds I have to learn or teach myself by coding in practise. Its very much about logic, yet very time consuming when trying to figure out something complex. It resulted in a sketch not really expressing wholly my initial idea, but does give an impression of what I wanted to do. Instead of focusing on the various ways to reach some of my ideas instead here I trained myself in understanding the coordinate system better, getting a stronger feeling about coding. I feel confident that my next exercise is gonna have more complex functions to it!
