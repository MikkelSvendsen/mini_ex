Mini exercise 4

Nothing really impressive here :b Just been playing around with some functions in order to teach myself. So what does it do? Well - theres a loop incorporated in the "for loop" functions of the blue and purple ellipses that "runs" over the screen. The blue ellipses has random sizes to them, while the purple ones has random transparency. I used the map function for the background to change colors according to the cursor position. The cursor itself has an ellipse and a map function to it as well, that changes size as it moves across the screen.

In order to show the feedback of a loop function I made the "bouncing" ball change color for every time it would bounce back and forth.

I simply tried out a lot of the functions we had for last class and I didn't go for anything creative in particular, but it gave me some idea of what is possible with coding. Even with relatively simple functions it seems possible to make some decent kind of abstract expressions through code.
