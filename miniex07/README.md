<h1>Form Art house!</h1>

This program is supposed to be opened with <b>Chrome</b> as apparently it appears different than intended when using Firefox.

So what did I do? Well basically I made a program that illustrates a house and a cloudy sky by using only elements of the DOM library - more specifically the radio, the sliders and the check-, input- and selectboxes.

<h2>What is it?</h2>
From bottom up: I laid the foundation (as described in the code) with the "selectboxes". My intentions were to make some kind of array with different textoptions in order to save some lines in the code, but I didn't manage to make it work. I settled myself with just having the 7 lines of code instead. I then moved on to making the walls of my house and decided to use "checkboxes". I simply made a loop of checkboxes at two different X positions and there I had my walls. 

Moving along I wanted to give my house a ceiling and I thought sliders would make up for a great ceiling. So like twice earlier already I looped 5 sliders with a variation to their position. In addition, for some interactivity, the ceiling sliders 3, 4 and 5 controls the background RGB while the 1st slider controls all other ceiling sliders (and thus the black/white level of the background).

After making these sliders I thought I'd like some cloudy weather on my canvas, so I contemplated on how to illustrate some movement through the DOM elements and came up with an idea to make clouds of tiny-sized zombie-sliders. This should give the notion of movement or wind or whatever (atleast thats the idea (remember to open in Chrome or I guess this wont work properly)).

Okay so to ward off some of that bad weather I figured my house would definitely need a roof. So I went to make some "radios" which I then looped in each their direction from the same x position (and almost Y). I then figured the rotational angle and number of radios suited in the loop for both directions to give it the visual I wanted (slightly tilted triangle or smth).

What I then need to do to my house was add to it a way in and some outpeak; a door and windows. I did this with three simple input textboxes. At last for the roof I created some more zombie-sliders with a slight offset for a cozy snake-like pattern.

<h3>My process</h3>
During the process of working with this sketch I figured a lot of stuff simply by trying out new things, much of it by intuition and just doing things "on the fly" and by my own. Some of it didn't work out, while some of it caused for smaller revelations in terms of what is possible and how I can string my stuff together. All in all this sketch is not very complicated or complex, but I find that working with it still gave me some insights to more complex coding. Ofc it caused for some frustrations along the way, I had to give up on some of my ideas because I simply couldn't make it happen. Despite these frustrations, however, I'm quite confident that going on with this coding in practice helps me slowly getting better at this stuff. Much of what I do now I had no idea about whatsoever at first class. And doing some things now just by intuition feelsgoodman.
