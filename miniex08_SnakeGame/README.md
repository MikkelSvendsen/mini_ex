<h1>Snake Game Challenge</h1>

This is a snake game that has been made with the code by Shiffman in his third challenge which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH#t=120.621937

The game initiates when the page is loaded and you control the snake by pressing left, right, up and down arrow. The snake grows larger when it eats food, and it dies if it hits itself or the walls.

<h2>What function/syntax has been added?</h2>

For the game there hasn't really been added any functions. What I did initially was change some of the stylings, remove strokes from rectangles and change colors a bit. I then implemented a slider only to change the background by its black/white contrasts.

<h3>What is the difficulty of this weekly exercise?</h3>

This mini exercise hasn't really been difficult - it was kind of a delight to follow Daniel Shiffman through the video. Only at one point did I miss a syntax error in my own code which caused for a short frustration, but figures that smallest things are often the ones messing everything up, so it really didn't take much time to solve the problem nor make the code in general.

What was more difficult was to keep track of why something is happening in the code while following the video and also understand it, but as I feel like I'm getting better at seeing through the code I also believe I'm getting some more insight and knowledge of how to read and write code by looking at these kind of simple, almost instruction videos. It is not just witchcraft.

I spent some time figuring out how to sort my flowchart in a good way. I could have detailed it more but I believe that this example gives a good image of what is going on within the game. The text and flow resembles that of the code fairly precise and does not move beyond the game functions but constrains itself within the game from a 'user controlling the snake' perspective. One thing that stand out in the game is the fact that you can turn the snake backwards from where it came and thus kill it. Another thing is the background slider. Neither of these things have been adressed through the flowchart.

<h4>How may we see, organize and communicate things differently with a flowchart?</h4>

The flowchart gives some advantages towards more aspects of programming. Reading and understanding code can be easier after breaking it down into bits and segments of action and consequence. Thus, from a communicative perspective, the flowchart is great at illustrating what is going on within a program as text, images and symbols help to create a conceptual idea of the program. The flowchart also grants the programmer a way to organize and have a better overview of his own code and the coding process, as he does not have to remember everything in his own mind while coding it - some of the fundamentals can be organized within the flowchart and then recalled by the programmer or other interests. In this sense it is not only good as an organizing and analyzing tool, it is also a good way of documenting creative coding processes.
