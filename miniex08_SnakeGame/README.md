<h1>Snake Game Challenge</h1>

This is a snake game that has been made with the code by Shiffman in his third challenge which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH#t=120.621937

The game initiates when the page is loaded and you control the snake by pressing left, right, up and down arrow. The snake grows larger when it eats food, and it dies if it hits itself or the walls.

<h2>What function/syntax has been added?</h2>

For the game there hasn't really been added any functions. What I did initially was change some of the stylings, remove strokes from rectangles and change colors a bit. I then implemented a slider only to change the background by its black/white contrasts.

<h3>What is the difficulty of this weekly exercise?</h3>

This mini exercise hasn't really been exactly difficult - it was kind of a delight to follow Daniel Shiffman through the video. Only at one point did I miss a syntax error in my own code which caused for a short frustration but figures that smallest things are often the ones messing everything up, so it really didn't take much time to solve the problem nor making the code in general.

What was more difficult was to keep track of why something is happening in the code while following the video, but as I feel like I'm getting better at seeing through the code I also believe I'm getting some more insight and knowledge of how to read and write code by looking at these kind of simple, almost instruction videos.

I spent some time figuring out how to sort my flowchart in a good way. I could have detailed it more but I believe that this example shows a fairly good image of what is going on within the game.
