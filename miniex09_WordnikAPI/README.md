<h1>Wordnik Search & Visualize</h1>

I've been experimentning with the Wordnik API but unfortunately, even after hours of work it won't work properly on GitHub, which means in order for you to run it you need the files locally. I've provided with some screenshots to show the functionality of my program.

<h3>Why did I choose Wordnik?</h3>

I didn't choose it for any particular reason really, I just kinda threw myself at it. I had looked upon other API's as well but figured the Wordnik API was relatively simple enough for me to start experimenting with.

<h3>The process of acquiring, processing, using and representing data for this miniex</h3>

This has been one of the harder mini exercises for me to solve. I reckon there are just about no limit to how it is possible to represent and visualize 'big data' through code. What was really tough initially was understanding the connection and syntaxes between the Wordnik JSON and how to express it through my own code. After a while and some times of trying I finally figured out how I was supposed to display different data, also in different ways.

First I started simply listing definitions and related words to the searched word. I experimented with some display ideas for this but figured that the frequency data of words were more in line with my ideas of visualizing Wordnik data. So I went on to make a visualization of the frequency of whatever searched word the user submits. The search spans from 1998 to 2012 and is divided into three subgroups of five years, all representing a different color:

1998 - 2002: RED
2003 - 2007: GREEN
2008 - 2012: BLUE

Examples of two searches are illustrated in screenshot 1 and 2 above. The first one showing the visual data of the word "big" and the second showing visual data of the word "data".
